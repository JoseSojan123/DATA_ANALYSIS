Welcome to the Inventory and Sales Data Analysis project! üöÄ This repository houses a robust set of Python scripts designed to provide deep insights into a company's inventory, purchases, sales, and vendor performance. By transforming raw data into a comprehensive vendor summary table, we unlock crucial metrics like profitability, stock turnover, and freight costs, empowering data-driven strategic decisions.




## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

Our project is organized for clarity and efficiency:

## üóÉÔ∏è Data

The `data/` directory contains the raw CSV files that serve as the foundation for our analysis. These include:

* `begin_inventory.csv`: Records of initial inventory levels.
* `end_inventory.csv`: Records of final inventory levels.
* `purchase_prices.csv`: Detailed information on product purchase prices.
* `purchases.csv`: Comprehensive records of all vendor purchase transactions.
* `sales.csv`: All sales transaction data.
* `vendor_invoice.csv`: Vendor invoice details, crucial for freight cost analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note on Data Availability:**
> The datasets used in this project were obtained from a paid source and are **not included** in this GitHub repository. To replicate the analysis, you would need to acquire similar inventory and sales data.

## üìù Log Files

The `logs/` directory stores `ingestion_db.log`, capturing detailed insights into the data ingestion and summary table creation processes. This helps in monitoring and debugging.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This project provides a comprehensive solution for inventory and sales analysis, featuring:

* **Data Ingestion üì•:** Efficiently loads raw CSV files into an SQLite database (`inventory.db`) for structured storage.
* **Robust Database Management üóÑÔ∏è:** Leverages `sqlite3` and `sqlalchemy` for seamless database operations, complemented by `pandas` for data manipulation.
* **Comprehensive Summary Table Creation üìä:** Joins various operational tables (`purchases`, `purchase_prices`, `vendor_invoice`, `sales`) to construct a holistic `final_summary_table` (aliased as `vendor_summary` in the DB). This table integrates:
    * Vendor purchase transaction details
    * Sales transaction data
    * Per-vendor freight costs
    * Actual product prices from vendors
* **Intelligent Data Cleaning & Transformation üßπ:**
    * Converts data types (e.g., `Volume` to `float64`) for accurate calculations.
    * Fills missing values with 0 to maintain data integrity.
    * Strips leading/trailing spaces from string columns (`VendorName`, `Description`) for consistency.
* **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Calculation üìà:** Derives crucial analytical metrics:
    * `GrossProfit`
    * `ProfitMargin`
    * `StockTurnover`
    * `SalesToPurchaseRatio`
* **Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç:** Delivers detailed statistical summaries, distribution plots (histograms, box plots), and correlation heatmaps to reveal data characteristics, patterns, and relationships.
* **Actionable Targeted Analysis & Insights üéØ:** Identifies specific business opportunities and challenges, including:
    * Brands requiring promotional or pricing adjustments (low sales, high profit margins).
    * Top-performing vendors and brands based on sales revenue.
    * Vendors contributing most to total procurement cost (via Pareto analysis).
    * The direct impact of bulk purchasing on unit price.
    * Vendors with low inventory turnover and high unsold inventory value, indicating potential overstocking.
* **Rigorous Hypothesis Testing ‚úÖ:** Conducts statistical tests (e.g., Two-Sample t-test) to validate insights, such as significant differences in profit margins between top-performing and low-performing vendors.
* **Detailed Logging ‚úçÔ∏è:** Provides comprehensive logs of all ingestion and data processing steps for transparency and traceability.

## üìú Scripts

This project is powered by several interconnected Python scripts, each serving a distinct purpose in the data pipeline.

### `ingestion_DB.py`

This script is the entry point for raw data loading. It systematically ingests all CSV files from the `data/` directory into the SQLite database.

### `eda.py`

This script focuses on initial data exploration within the database. It demonstrates how to query and inspect the ingested tables, perform basic aggregations, and understand the raw data structure.

### `get_summary_table.py`

This is the core data processing script. It's responsible for joining disparate tables and calculating the derived KPIs to build the comprehensive `vendor_summary` table, which is then stored back in the database for analysis.

### `visualanalysis.py`

The powerhouse of insights! This script performs in-depth statistical analysis and generates a suite of visualizations from the `vendor_summary` table, helping to answer key business questions and validate hypotheses.

## üìà Visual Insights

`visualanalysis.py` generates various charts to provide a clear picture of the inventory and sales data.

### Numerical Columns Distributions (Histograms and Box Plots)

These plots help us understand the spread, central tendency, and outliers for key numerical variables like Purchase Price, Actual Price, Gross Profit, etc.
